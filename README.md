## System Setup and Installation Guide (For Linux/WSL) If Need

### 1. System Dependency Installation

The following dependencies are required to compile and run Python projects that rely on system-level libraries. You only need to install them **once per machine**.

#### Install Required Packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev \
libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

> **Note:** This step is essential only for fresh Linux/WSL environments. If these dependencies are already installed (from a previous project), you may skip this section.

---

#### 2. (Optional) Install Python 3.12.x from Source

If the required Python version (e.g., 3.12.3) is not available in your package manager, you can manually build it:

#### Download and Compile Python:

```bash
cd /usr/src
sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/Python-3.12.3.tgz
sudo tar xzf Python-3.12.3.tgz
cd Python-3.12.3
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make -j$(nproc)
sudo make altinstall
```

> **Warning:** Use `make altinstall` (not `make install`) to avoid replacing the default system Python.

You now have Python 3.12.x installed as `python3.12`.

## 3. Project Setup Instructions

Once system dependencies and Python are set:

#### 3.1 Create a Virtual Environment and Install Project Requirements:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3.2set the .env from example.env


You are now ready to start development or run the project.


## Project Run
step-1: sudo service redis-server start
step-2: python3 -m daphne bugtracker.asgi:application

## Swagger Docs
    `/docs/`

## API endpoints
#### User Registration  
**POST** `/api/v1/registration/`  
Create a new user account. Returns JWT access and refresh tokens on success.

#### User Login (Token Obtain)  
**POST** `/api/v1/token/`  
Authenticate user credentials and receive JWT access and refresh tokens.

#### Token Refresh  
**POST** `/api/v1/token/refresh/`  
Send a valid refresh token to get a new access token without re-authenticating.

#### 1. Project CRUD API
**URL:** `/api/v1/project/`  
**Methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`  
**Permissions:** Authenticated users only  

- **GET**  
  - Retrieve all projects, or a specific project by providing `project_id` as a query parameter.  
  - Example:  
    ```
    GET /api/v1/project/?project_id=1
    ```

- **POST**  
  - Create a new project. The authenticated user is set as the owner.  
  - Required JSON body parameters:  
    - `name` (string)  
    - `description` (string)

- **PATCH**  
  - Partially update a project using the `project_id` query parameter and the fields to update in the request body.  
  - Example:  
    ```
    PATCH /api/v1/project/?project_id=1
    Body: { "description": "Updated description" }
    ```

- **DELETE**  
  - Delete a project by its `project_id`.  
  - Example:  
    ```
    DELETE /api/v1/project/?project_id=1
    ```

#### 2. Bug CRUD API

**URL:** `/api/v1/bug/`  
**Methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`  
**Permissions:** Authenticated users only  

- **GET**  
  - Retrieve bugs, optionally filtered by `bug_id`, `project_id`, or `status`.  
  - Examples:  
    ```
    GET /api/v1/bug/?bug_id=5
    GET /api/v1/bug/?project_id=1&status=Open
    ```

- **POST**  
  - Create a new bug. The authenticated user is set as the creator.  
  - Required JSON body parameters:  
    - `title` (string)  
    - `description` (string)  
    - `status` (Open, In Progress, Resolved)  
    - `priority` (Low, Medium, High)  
    - `project` (project ID)

- **PATCH**  
  - Partially update a bug using the `bug_id` query parameter.

- **DELETE**  
  - Delete a bug by `bug_id`.

#### 3. Comment CRUD API

**URL:** `/api/v1/comment/`  
**Methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`  
**Permissions:** Authenticated users only  

- **GET**  
  - Retrieve all comments or filter by `comment_id`.

- **POST**  
  - Create a new comment. The authenticated user is set as the commenter.  
  - Required JSON body parameters:  
    - `bug` (bug ID)  
    - `message` (string)

- **PATCH**  
  - Partially update a comment using the `comment_id` query parameter.

- **DELETE**  
  - Delete a comment by `comment_id`.

---

#### 4. Assigned Bugs API

**URL:** `/api/v1/bugs/assigned/`  
**Method:** `GET`  
**Permissions:** Authenticated users only  

- Retrieve bugs assigned to the authenticated user, or specify a user by `user_id` query parameter.  



# how to test WebSocket events.
#### 1st: Connect a WebSocket client (e.g., websocat, browser console, Postman WebSocket tab) to the URL ws://<your-domain>/ws/bugtracker/<project_id>/?token=<your_jwt_access_token>.   When connecting to the WebSocket, you need to pass the JWT token as a query parameter (e.g., ?token=your_jwt_token) for authentication.

#### 2nd: Once connected, any bug created or updated (even through normal API calls) will automatically trigger notifications to all connected clients in that projectâ€™s WebSocket group.This works because the backend uses Django signals to listen for bug model changes and broadcasts events through WebSockets to all users connected to the project room.
#### 3rd: The commenter uses the normal API to create the comment. The backend signal detects the new comment and sends a WebSocket event. The bug creator and the assigned user, if connected with a valid JWT token via WebSocket, will receive the notification instantly.

#### 4th: For testing the typing indicator event via Postman (WebSocket tab), you just send this JSON message in the message box: Once sent, the backend will broadcast this typing notification to other connected users in the same project room (except you).
